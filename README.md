Deep Declarative Networks - Summary Research Bursary
---

A project with the goal to explore [deep declarative networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04866), following from their [github repo](https://github.com/anucvml/ddn).

Most of the time was spent trying to implement [normalised cuts](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/SM-ncut.pdf) as a deep declarative node

All the useful information and code are found in jupyter notebooks and markdown files:

A natural progression point might be to implement normalised cuts in a similar fashion to 
https://github.com/anucvml/ddn/blob/master/tutorials/10_least_squares.ipynb
such that the mathematics would be verified beforehand, allowing hand implementations as well as autograd implementation
